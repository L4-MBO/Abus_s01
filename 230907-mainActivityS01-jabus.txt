Hi, My name is Justin Brian Abus.
I am currently studying in DLSU-D and is taking up Computer Science as my course, we are currently doing our thesis for our requirement in graduating. We are attending harder classes compared to the last years and I am deeply intereseted in learning more. I also recently accomplished my internship in TaskUs and I am now excited in applying everything I learned there in my studies.
